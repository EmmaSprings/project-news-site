# project-news-site

build a news site, chose to to a kids version for space matters. Played around with hover effect, tried to learn flexbox. 
I would like to call this way of learning: "by mistakes". I have made them and there are proably a lot left in there or things I coul've done better etc but this is a part of the process so I'm looking forward to take a look at this project by the end of this bootcamo to see what (if) I've learned.
